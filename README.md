Once upon a time a psychology professor walked around on a stage while teaching stress management principles to an auditorium filled with students.  
As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they would be asked the typical glass half empty or glass half full question.  
Instead, with a smile on her face, the professor asked, How heavy is this glass of water I am holding?
